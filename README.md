### Planned features

+ Easy navigation of the Lithium directory structure. `gf` considers context and knows about elements, fixtures, and much more. There are two commands, `:A` (alternate) and `:R` (related) for easy jumping between files, including favorites like model to test cases, view to helper, and controller to functional test. For more advanced usage, `:Rmodel`, `:Rview`, `:Rcontroller`, and several other commands are provided. `:help lithium-navigation`
+ Interface to `li3` console command. Use `:li3 command` to execute Lithium's built-in commands or any custom command of your own.
